Thank you for taking the time for reporting a bug, requesting a feature, or letting me know something else about the package.

I create open-source packages for fun while working full-time and running my own business. That means I don't have as much time left to maintain these packages, build elaborate new features or investigate and fix bugs. If you wish to get a feature or bugfix merged it would be greatly appreciated if you can provide as much info as possible and preferably a Pull Request ready with automated tests. Realistically I check Github a few times a week, and take several days, weeks or sometimes months before finishing features/bugfixes (depending on their size of course).

Thanks for understanding. 😁
